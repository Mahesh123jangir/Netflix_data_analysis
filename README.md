Overview of the project: Python-based normal data analysis of the Netflix Dataset in Jupyter Notebook

In this research, we will examine a dataset that contains details on Netflix-accessible films and TV series.
The dataset, which was gathered through Kaggle, includes details like the title, director, cast, release year,
nation, and rating. To do the analysis, Jupyter Notebook and Python will be used.


1. Identify the most popular movie and television show genres on Netflix.
2. To examine the distribution of films and TV series based on their year of release.
3. To determine which nations have the most Netflix films and TV series available.
4. To examine the Netflix ratings distribution for both films and TV shows.
5. To spot recurring themes and trends in the Netflix material.

Methodology:
1. Cleaning the data: We will purge the data of unnecessary columns and deal with missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand the data and spot patterns and trends, we shall do EDA.
3. Data Visualisation: To show our findings, we'll make use of visualisations including bar graphs, line graphs,
   and scatter plots.
4. Statistical Analysis: To find correlations and trends in the data, statistical analysis will be used.

Tools Applied
1. Python: Python will be used to analyse and visualise data.
2. Jupyter Notebook: To write and run our code, we'll use Jupyter Notebook.
3. Pandas: Pandas will be used to clean and manipulate data.
4. Matplotlib: To visualise data, we'll use Matplotlib.
5. Seaborn: For sophisticated data visualisation, we'll use Seaborn.

At the conclusion of this research, we hope to get new perspectives on the content Netflix has to offer, 
spot trends and patterns, and make suggestions for the streaming service. We anticipate that this project
will assist Netflix in enhancing its user experience and content library.

In order to identify trends and insights, this project will analyse a dataset including data about films 
and TV episodes that are available on Netflix. We will undertake data cleansing, exploratory data analysis,
data visualisation, and statistical analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook to learn more about the data.
We anticipate that this project will help Netflix build out its content catalogue and improve users' viewing pleasure.
